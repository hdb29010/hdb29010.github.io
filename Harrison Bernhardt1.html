<H2>About Me </H2>

<CENTER>
Hello, I am a student at the University of Georgia and I am majoring in Real Estate. 
I am from Atlanta, Georgia and I intend to return there for work after college. 
I'm looking for a job in commercial real estate, hopefully in a brokering firm where i can put together deals for 
major companies by finding them office spaces all over Metro Atlanta, Buckhead, and most of The greater Atlanta Regions.

<H3> My Family </H3>
<Center>
I am a big family man, I love my family. I have my two parents Jim and Jill Bernhardt who also had my brother 
3 years before they had me. My Brothers name is Garrett Bernhardt and he now works for the PGA in West Palm Beach. 
I grew up very close to him and i still am pretty close with him. He travels all over the country and always brings me 
something back from the cities he visits. My mother works for a radio station and manages advertisement while my 
dad works for an IT company and works with sales to get the software out to its customers. I don't have a very 
large family but I wouldn't trade them for the world.  


<H3>My High School </H3>

<CENTER>
I went to High school at St. Pius X Catholic High school, It is a catholic school in Atlanta 
Georgia. I played two sports through out my 4 years including Football and Golf.
I played offense and defense in football and enjoyed my time there because it taught me discipline 
and showed me what hard work does. I went to Georgia dome twice which was an unbelievable experience
to play wheres the pros play. Unfortunately, we lost both times we went to state but it was still a once
and a life time experience.
